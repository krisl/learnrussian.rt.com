						<p class="MsoNormal">The Russian word klaveeatura translates as keyboard. It was borrowed from German, which used a Latin root. In modern Russian, the word is mostly used to mean a computer keyboard, but, like in English, klaveeatura can also refer to keys of a musical instrument.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first part of the word sounds similar to the Russian female name Klava, which is often used to mean klaveeatura in slang.</p>
