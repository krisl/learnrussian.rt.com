Originally the word comes from the root “rab” which, when used as an independent word in modern Russian, means slave. The fact gives rise to numerous jokes about rabota being modern-day slavery.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russians also often say that rabota is not a wolf and will not run away to the woods, meaning that work which has to be done can wait.</p><p></p>
