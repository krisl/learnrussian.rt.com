						<p class="BodyA">Russia is a big country, which has a lot of to offer. We all are familiar with the main stereotypes of Russia, but not that many people know about the many attractions in Russia that are worth seeing.</p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">Among the main attractions in Russia are the wonders of nature. Take Lake Baikal—the world’s oldest, deepest and clearest lake. Or the Valley of Geysers on Kamchatka Peninsula—the second largest concentration of geysers in the world! The Ural mountains,&nbsp; Siberia in the North, the vast steppes in the South—the list can go on! </p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">Other attractions in Russia include rich architectural, cultural and historical heritage. When people plan a trip to Russia, they mainly want to visit such attractions in Russia as St. Basil’s cathedral, the Kremlin, the Red Square and the Tretyakov Gallery in the big and buzzing with life Moscow. The amazing Golden Ring of Russia with its stunning centuries-old churches and monasteries. The many museums, palaces and parks in the beautiful and mysterious St. Petersburg.</p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">But there are also those, who go for less known attractions in Russia: Lake Baskunchak (the Russian equivalent of the Dead Sea) in Volgograd, the Kremlin in Nizhny Novgorod or Kazan... And what about the many churches and monasteries with incredible stone and woodword, icons and murals?</p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">Many attractions in Russia are located in big cities, but even more are spread throughout Russia like hidden gems.</p>
