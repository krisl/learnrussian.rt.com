RT has hired a team of professional linguists to offer you more than just free Russian language lessons online — it is a unique comprehensive course in modern Russian. The course suits learners of all levels as it starts with the very basics and gradually introduces more difficult material based on what has been worked on so far.

In addition to putting free Russian language lessons online, RT has bundled them with audio files and illustrations to make learning easier and more fun. Examples of usage provided in the course reflect natural modern Russian as it is spoken.
