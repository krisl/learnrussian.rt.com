						<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Several
decades ago, there was not much diversity in the range of Russian jobs. Most
people were far from spoiled when it came to choice: they opted for being a
doctor, an engineer, or a teacher.&nbsp; There
were also some other jobs in demand on the list. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today the
situation with the job market has changed dramatically. Thousands of new CVs
and job offers appear on various websites designed to be mediators between
those looking for jobs and those providing them, making the Russian jobs market
energetic. Looking for a job, be it a first job or the next stage in one’s
career, can turn out to be an exciting job hunt offering a wealth of
opportunities and exciting prospects. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The variety
of Russian jobs ranges from PR and marketing to finance and banking—everybody
has a chance to find something to realize his ambitions. The new reality of
life dictates the appearance of new positions: if you are interested in social
media, you may well become a social media manager, if you are interested in
search engines—why not try your hand as a SEO specialist.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
