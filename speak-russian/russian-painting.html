						<p class="MsoNormal">Russia’s art legacy is extremely versatile and diverse, and “a Russian painting” is a broad phenomenon in its own right. Is it possible to single out one Russian painting in this range of outstanding works of various genres and epochs? The criteria might vary from how accurately the artist abides to the artistic norms of this or that art style to what impressions his “Russian painting” arouses. However, one may rely on professional point of view and commercial success of Russian paintings. The results of art sales of auction houses may come in handy here.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One of most signature works of Russian art is “Suprematist Composition,” by Russian avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich. Bold exuberant geometrical figures positioned on light background became an iconic example of the art movement the Russian painter originated—Suprematism.&nbsp; This Russian painting is much admired by art connoisseurs all over the world and craved for those who can spend as much as $US 60 mln—this staggering sum was spent on this Russian painting at Sotheby’s Impressionist and Modern Art sale in New York in November 2008.</p>
