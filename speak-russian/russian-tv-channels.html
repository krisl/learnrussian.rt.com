Everyone can find a channel with something that they like to watch. The channel with the biggest budget and TV audience is Channel One, the first television channel to broadcast in the Soviet Union. Now it’s countrywide. Some other major Russian TV channels are the state channels Rossiya 1, Rossiya 2 and Rossiya 24 as well as Gazprom-supported NTV. There are also special channels that focus primarily on news, fitness, sports, culture, and entertainment.</p><p> There are a number of Russian TV channels that primarily deal with entertainment: STS, TNT, Domashny, Muz-TV, 2x2 and MTV-Russia. ‘Zhivi’ is a cable TV channel that promotes fitness and healthy lifestyles.
