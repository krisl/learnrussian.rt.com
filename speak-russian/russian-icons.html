						<p class="MsoNormal">Since Russia adopted Christianity in 988, it has become integrated in Byzantine art. Russian interpretation has given rise to a whole host of sacred artistic work—icons. Russian icons are characterized by adherence to strict rules—canon. They featured a set of subject matter and types of images. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Most of the crafty examples of Russian icons, especially those created before the end of XV century, are anonymous – the painter was considered as a mere executor rather than a creator of the work. However, arguably the most famous of the surviving Russian icons famously belongs to the XV century Russian master Andrey Rublyov (<b>Андрей Рублёв</b>).</p><p class="MsoNormal">Trinity depicts the three angels and the episode of a holy history, but the painting is full of symbolism and often interpreted as an icon of the Holy Trinity. In his work Rublev transmits his inner feelings rather than concentrating on the details or conforming to the accepted norms of depicting the episode. </p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The artistic style of Andrey Rublyov is intrinsically Russian, yet owes much to art of Byzantium and antiquity thanks to it noble simplicity and elegance.&nbsp;</p>
