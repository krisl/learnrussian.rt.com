						<p class="MsoNormal">By Russian cat we usually mean the Russian blue—a cat with a coat silver-blue color. It is one of the most well-known breeds in the world and one of the most popular types of shorthair cats.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why is this feline creature called Russian? The answer is simple: it originated in Russia and set out on a journey to Europe at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century from the Russian port city of Arkhangelsk. The cat was first called the Arkhangelsk Blue in tribute to its port of origin.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Russian cat is also surrounded by many legends. It is said that the first mentions of the cat date back to the times of the Russian tsar Peter I, who is said to have owned a Russian blue pet, and Catherine II presented kittens of this breed to ambassadors of foreign powers. </p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some Russian blues are actually black or white in color.</p>
