						<p>How to say stuff in Russian is a difficult question. There is no direct translation and much depends on the situation.

The safest way to say stuff in Russian when speaking about a concrete object without naming it is to use the word ‘eto’. It translates as ‘this’ and should be stressed in a sentence so that the listener understands there is an object behind it.

Another way to refer to a concrete but unnamed object is the word ‘shtuka’. It is colloquial and roughly translates as ‘piece’, but can go far beyond this meaning. An even more colloquial variant of the word is ‘shtukovina’.

To say stuff in Russian and sound very colloquial, use ‘erunda’ or ‘fignya’. Both can refer to concrete objects or abstract notions, but be cautious as they in most cases show the speaker’s disapproval.

If you want to say stuff in Russian where in English you would say ‘and stuff’ or ‘and stuff like that’, say ‘i vsyo takoe’.

And remember, it is always best to name things, especially in a formal conversation, and this course is just designed to expand your vocabulary and enable you to call things by their proper names.</p>
