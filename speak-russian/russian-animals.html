						    <h1>Russian Animals</h1>
						
						
						<p>Just like many other countries, Russia has its own, Russian animals. Bears - &nbsp;especially the Russian brown bear, wolves, foxes, hares, hedgehogs, Arctic foxes, Siberian tigers, lynx, sables, weasels and minks are considered by many Russians to be the principal Russian animals. </p><p> Some of these animals are found in other parts of the world, too, but most of them live only in Russia. There’s a saying that if you doubt the origin of an animal, ask yourself if you can make a hat out of it. If yes, then it lives in Russia! Russian animals - or rather their fur - often save people who live in the north of Russia from extreme minus temperatures and keep them warm throughout very long, dreary, and freezing cold winters.</p><p> Russian animals are also frequently mentioned in Russian folklore. Animals are the main characters in many Russian fairytales: they are given human abilities, including the ability to speak, wit or stupidity, and a sense of humour.</p><p> You will learn the names of Russian animals as well as their correct pronunciation with our interactive online Russian language course, RT Learn Russian.</p><div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Learn more:<o:p></o:p></span></p></div><div><a href="http://learnrussian.rt.com/lessons/nouns-their-gender/" title="">Do you know that the names of Russian animals are animate nouns?
