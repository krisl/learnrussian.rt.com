						    <h1>Russian Architecture</h1>
						
						
						<p class="MsoNormal">Russian architecture is filled with the Christian faith. Starting from the 9th century—shortly after Russia adopted Christianity in 10th century—there have been splendid churches, embellished by mosaics, paintings, frescos and icons. Many Russian cities and towns still retain gems of architecture of the Middle Ages: Novgorod Veliky, Vladimir, Suzdal, Pereslavl-Zalessky are real museums under the open sky. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The Moscow Kremlin in the Russian capital has become the face of old Russian architecture. The first cathedral was built there in the 15th century by the Italian architect Aristotel Fiorovanti. This snow-white cathedral made of stone employs traits of traditional Russian architecture, but the geometrical distinct lines and light interiors reveal the signature of the Italian master. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Side by side with the Kremlin, at the very heart of Moscow on Red Square is St. Basil’s Cathedral. Despite being a bright (in all senses) testimony of architectural gift, it’s also an important historical monument, commemorating an important victory of Russian troops under Tsar Ivan the Terrible. Bold multi-colored domes make the cathedral one of the landmarks of the Russian capital and a real gem of Russian architecture<b>.</b></p><p> This and many other cathedrals and churches all over Russia testify to the splendor of Russian architecture. However, civilian architecture of more recent periods is also marked by masterpieces.&nbsp;</p>
