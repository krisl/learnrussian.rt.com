						    <h1>Russian Beauties</h1>
						
						
						<p>For centuries Russian beauties have been known throughout the world. While it’s true that every nation has their share of beauties, the ones that seem to never cease to attract attention are the cold and mysterious Russian beauties.</p><p> Portraits of the most beautiful Russian women of past centuries now grace museums and art galleries in Russia and all over the world. To name just a few: Varvara Rimskaya-Korsakova, Zinaida Yusupova, and Yulia Samoilova.</p><p> The names of modern Russian beauties as well as their faces are recognized worldwide: Natalya Vodyanova, Irina Shayk, Sasha Pivovarova, Evgeniya Volodina, Olga Pantyushenkova... Russian top-models who have become stars on the world’s most famous podiums.</p><p> Some Russian beauties of the past were actresses, ballerinas, poetesses, women of art and literature. Others were simple peasants or bondservants. But each and every one of them was a muse and a source of inspiration to prominent people in literature and art.</p><p> Russian beauties were and always will be about a combination of inner beauty and intellect with beautiful appearances. Even today Russians emphasize the difference between the cold, empty beauty, which is just about looks, and the true inspiring beauty that we’ve been admiring for centuries.</p>
