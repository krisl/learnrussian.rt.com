						<p>Some words in the Russian language are quite easy—for a change. What makes them easy is that their Russian form is exactly the same as the English one. One of those words you will definitely use when you want to say “stop” in Russian.

So, if you want to say “stop” in Russian, just say “<b>stop</b>”. It’s a general word that can be used to tell someone not to do something or not to go somewhere. But Russian is called “a rich language” for a reason. So, many actions have their own “stop”—word or two.

For example, if you want to urge someone not to go somewhere and say “stop” in Russian, go for “<b>stoy</b>”, ”<b>ostanovis</b>” or “<b>stoyte</b>”, ”<b>ostanovites</b>”. The first, more informal version is used for one person, a family member, or a friend. The second one is said either to a group of people, to a person older than you, or a stranger. If you want to say “stop” in Russian to someone who is talking a lot or if you want to indicate that something is enough, you can just say “<b>hvatit</b>”.

When you explore Russian more in-depth, you will see that there are more ways to say “stop” in Russian. Discoveries like that will make your learning process much more interesting and fun!</p><p><br></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:18.0pt;line-height:115%;
