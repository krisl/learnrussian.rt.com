						<p>Even the most complex languages have basic words that are simple and easy to remember and to use. People often learn them before they have any idea of how to put them into a sentence. As life shows, sometimes a word is all it takes to be understood.

Learning simple words in Russian is a good place to start, should you want to study this interesting (and at times confusing) language for work or fun. Not all simple words are that easy though. RT Russian provides audio and video illustrations for selected simple words in Russian to make sure that you get things right from the beginning.

Knowledge of basic words will also make you more comfortable when traveling in Russia, especially if it’s your first time here. Russians will understand you even if you can only use simple words in Russian for the time being.
