						<p>If you have made the decision to study Russian, chances are one of your goals is to learn how to speak Russian.  If you don’t live in or have other contact with a Russian-speaking community, this can be a challenge.  While studying grammar and vocabulary is important, knowing how to speak Russian comes from real practice.  

Preparation can be done by reading and listening, but chances are when you speak with real Russians, they won’t sound like textbooks.  Knowing how to speak Russian is something you can be better prepared for with video polls we conduct on the streets of Moscow.  We ask questions, people answer as they think.  You will learn how to speak Russian based upon the answers, words, and intonation you hear.  

Our course also provides you with Russian language classes held around the English-speaking world and with a database of tutors.  

You have tools to learn how to speak Russian available at your fingertips.  The most important thing is to not be shy.  Be ready to speak and actually talk when people give you the opportunity.  Even if you aren’t sure how to speak Russian, you will never be able to if you don’t first try - so find a Russian friend and do just that!</p><div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:18.0pt;line-height:115%;
