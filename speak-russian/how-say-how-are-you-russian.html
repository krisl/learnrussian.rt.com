						<p>The question ‘How are you?’ is the most widespread conversation-opener. Here is your quick guide on how to say ‘how are you’ in Russian.

The most common and neutral way to say ‘how are you’ in Russian is </p><b>kak dela?</b><p>. A bit more personal are </p><b>kak ty?</b><p>&nbsp;and </p><b>kak pozhivaesh?</b><p>, when talking to close friends or family members, and </p><b>kak vy?</b><p>&nbsp;and </p><b>kak pozhivaete?</b><p>, suitable for conversations with people you are less familiar with.

If you want to add a casual philosophical touch to your 'how are you'&nbsp;in Russian, ask </p><b>kak zhizn?</b><p>, which translates as ‘how is life?’. Some Russians prefer to replace the word </p><b>zhizh</b><p>&nbsp;with the personal pronoun </p><b>ona</b><p>&nbsp;and ask </p><b>kak ona?</b><p>, which stands for ‘how is it?’, but it is not perceived as an accepted standard way of saying ‘how are you’ in Russian by all. However if you like the pattern, you may just change&nbsp;</p><b>ona</b><p>&nbsp;to </p><b>ono</b><p>&nbsp;and say </p><b>kak ono?</b><p>—but mind that it is rather colloquial and usually refers to something one is occupied with right now rather than life in general and will translate as ‘how is it going?’.</p>
