						<p class="BodyA">The Russian New Year is arguably the most important day on the Russian holiday calendar. Just like anywhere in the world, the Russian New Year is celebrated on the thirty first of December, but preparations for the day start way before!</p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">During the times of the Soviet Union, the Russian New Year was the main winter holiday, as all religious holidays, including Christmas, were officially banned. </p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">Most of the traditions of the Russian New Year come from the Soviet times, when the choice of products in stores wasn’t that abundant and women had to be creative in cooking with what they got. Times have changed, but in many Russian homes you can still see the standard food for the Russian New Year: fresh tangerines and oranges, champagne, the Russian salad (also known as “Olivie”), the “Herring in a fur coat” salad, toasted brown bread with sprats and lemons, and a homemade layered cake.</p><p class="BodyA">&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyA">Among other popular traditions for celebrating the Russian New Year are the decorating of the New Year tree, watching the all-time favorite movie “The Irony of Fate”, listening to the Presidential address to the nation, counting the twelve strikes of the main clock of the country and making a wish that should come true in the year to come!</p>
