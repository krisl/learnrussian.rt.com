						<p>Do you think that Russian is a difficult language?  If you answered yes to that question, you might want to think again.  Mastering Russian grammar can be a challenge, but something you can and will do with our course.  

You will learn parts of speech, how to decline nouns and adjectives, conjugate verbs, and learn the basics of other Russian grammar concepts - like double negation.

One thing that definitely makes Russian an easy language is that it uses no articles.  Just think how lucky you are that Russian grammar doesn’t make you think about what is definite and indefinite - like unfortunate people who study English must do!

The basic word order in Russian grammar is subject-verb-object - a pattern that English follows, too.  Russian grammar is a bit more tricky here, though, because other combinations are possible in order to provide different emphasis.  It’s more of a game than a brain buster, though!

Properly mastering Russian grammar requires instruction and practice - all of which is provided to you by RT Russian.

Even if your ultimate goal is conversation skills, Russian grammar is crucial to actually using the language properly and in a way people will respect.  Our extensive database of lessons will answer any questions you might have about Russian grammar.</p>
