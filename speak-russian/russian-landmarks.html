						<p class="MsoNormal">Any visitor to Russia should know that Russian landmarks are countless so one trip is obviously not enough to see even the most important ones while visiting them all is something that can take many years.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The list of Russian landmarks is topped by the Kremlin of Moscow. It is considered to be the heart of the capital and the heart of the country. The Kremlin alone can take you days to explore—and do not forget about all of the other sights Moscow has to offer tourists.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">If you are after places less busy and buzzing than the capital, then your destination should be Saint Petersburg, second on the list of Russian landmarks and often called Russia’s Northern and cultural capital.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Russian landmarks are not only connected with history or culture—some of them are genuine natural wonders. Lake Baikal, for instance, located in the south of Siberia was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 and is the world’s most voluminous freshwater lake. Moreover, it is the world’s oldest and deepest lake and home to many species of plants and animals which can be found nowhere else on the planet.</p>
