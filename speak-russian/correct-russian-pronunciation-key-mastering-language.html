						<p>Russian pronunciation can be a challenge for many people learning the language.  Vowel sounds can change depending on whether the letter is stressed or unstressed, consonants can be either hard or soft, and there are sounds that simply don’t occur in your native tongue.

Russian pronunciation is crucial in being both understood and respected when you are speaking the language.  Many Russians can be either unable or unwilling to listen to anyone butcher their language, so your Russian pronunciation can be key in actually being able to talk to some people.

Don’t worry too much, though, because plenty of Russians are very helpful and understanding to foreigners speaking their language.  Many even find it endearing to hear different accents of spoken Russian.

They will enable you to improve your Russian pronunciation and also be exposed to a variety of real, modern voices.  This course is filled with instructional audio and video files recorded by native speakers.  

Sometimes the sounds of the Russian language can be tongue twisters, but with the right instruction and listening skills, you should be able to train yourself to have excellent, if not perfect, Russian pronunciation.</p><div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:18.0pt;line-height:115%;
