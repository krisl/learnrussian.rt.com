						<p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Russian
costume has roots in Russian folk attire, which, as historians of fashion
claim, reflects Russian national character. Bright colors, many embellishments,
ornaments, and patterns show the cheerful nature of Russian people with the
long-standing tradition of Russian folk art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the centre
of the traditional Russian costume is the </span><b>рубаха</b><span lang="EN-US">—rubakha—a
shirt originally made of fine linen. The name comes from the word </span><b>руб</b><span lang="EN-US">—rub—a piece of fabric. It was an important part of the wardrobes of
both men and women, worn daily and on festive occasions, as well. The sleeves
of the shirt were richly decorated with embroidery and were quite long—one
needed to tuck them in to do manual labor. This feature has given rise to the saying—</span><b>работать</b><b> спустя</b><b> рукава</b><span lang="EN-US">—literally translated as “to work
with the sleeves un-tucked” —to work with the left hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another
item considered by some as the symbol of the traditional Russian costume is </span><b>сарафан</b> <span lang="EN-US">—sarafan—a floor-length dress. It is comprised of many
components and can be very heavy. The name of this bright dress, which is
predominantly red in color, comes from the Iranian language. Interestingly,
sarafans were long worn by both women and men, and only in the and only in the 17th
century did they gain the status as a symbol of femininity.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p></p>
