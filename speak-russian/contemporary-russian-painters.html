Contemporary Russian painters touch upon topical issues, revealing their view on the social situation, and strive to find new ways of expressing themselves.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Big bold signs and letters placed in unconventional graphical compositions are signature style of a young contemporary Russian painter Egor Koshelev. He started off by drawing graffiti on Moscow backstreets and ended up in some of the most trendy art spaces of the city. Today the lovers of contemporary art are trying to look into philosophy of this Russian painter through his huge graffiti-like artworks.&nbsp; </p><p class="MsoNormal">On the other side of the spectrum are more mature contemporary Russian painters, who, side by side with the younger generations, present Russia on major art events and displays around the world.
