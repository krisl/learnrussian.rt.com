						<p>Getting used to the Russian alphabet is nothing to be worried about for several reasons. Many of the letters it contains do not differ from the Latin script. And, fortunately, some of them even stand for the same sounds.

RT is offering you a simple guide to pronouncing the Russian alphabet complete with audio recorded by professional native speakers and a colorful chart which you can visualize any time you need to spell a Russian word or someone spells a Russian word for you.

Pronouncing the Russian alphabet is something you learn early on as a foundation for your further study.

Pronouncing the Russian alphabet fluently and without a hitch gives you your first opportunity to impress friends and feel serious about learning a language spoken by millions of people across the globe.

But keep in mind that pronouncing the Russian alphabet may be different from pronouncing its letters in words.
