						<p class="MsoNormal">One of the most provocative artists on the scene of contemporary Russian art is Andrey Molodkin, known for his explosive artwork and notorious political pieces, along with plans to turn human bodies into oil as a symbol of re-birth. One of his latest works is Transformer no. V579 installation—a monumental corridor of oil and light that viewers must pass through in order to understand the author’s philosophy behind his work. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Networked electronic objects, infrared LEDs, a huge distorted iPod—state-of-the-art objects get a new look and meaning in works by Russian art collective Electrobutique.
