						    <h1>Russian Music</h1>
						
						
						<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout its history, Russia has been home to many talented people, some of whom are today internationally renowned scientists, writers, poets, politicians, and musicians. The latter have made Russian music known and loved in many parts of the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about Russian music is certainly Russian folk music and a traditional Russian musical instrument—the balalaika.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Russian music is not limited to just folk tunes. Russia has given the world a great number of brilliant composers like Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov whose works are performed across the globe as part of the classical repertoire.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Modern Russian music may not be that popular or well-known outside Russia but there are names who make splashes. One of the examples is the dance duo t.A.T.u. whose English single “All the Things She Said” topped most European charts in 2002 and 2003. Another one is pop singer Dima Bilan who won the Eurovision Song Contest with his song “Believe” in 2008.</p>
