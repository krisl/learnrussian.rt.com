						<p class="MsoNormal">Russian abstract art thrived for several decades at the beginning of the 20th century. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Non-figurative art appeared in Russia at the dawn of the 20th century and has a detailed destiny in this country. It evolved as an art form caused and supported by the socio-political situation. The revolutionary spirit reigning in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century conformed to the main principles of Russian abstract art which were quite revolutionary: visualization of emotions, philosophic issues, and concepts rather than depicting objects of material reality. However, the very same art movement was accused of lacking a message at the end of the 20th century. It took the shape of avant-garde art in the beginning of the 20th century and that of non-conformist art in 1960s—1990s. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Russian abstract art<b> </b>has changed the essence of art and the place of the creator in the process of the creation of art. It is an artistic-philosophical method, rather than just a movement in visual arts. Just like world abstract art, Russian abstract art is presented in sculpture, cinema, and photography. In visual arts one of the examples of abstract art is Vasily Kandinsky and the “Blue Rider” group of artists. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Abstract art involves viewers and addressees of the artwork to co-create it, to interpret it in their own way. So, what do you see when you look at the “Black Square” by Malevich?&nbsp;</p>
