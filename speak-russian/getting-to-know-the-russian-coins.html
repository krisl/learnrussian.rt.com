						<p class="MsoNormal">Even though the world is gradually switching to non-cash payments with Russia following the trend, cash is still widely used in the country. This, combined with the fact that all payments in Russia have to be made in the national currency—the Russian rouble, makes an encounter with Russian banknotes and Russian coins inevitable for anyone on a visit.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The smallest of Russian coins in value and size is 1 kopeck—one hundredth of a rouble. Russian coins smaller than 1 rouble also come in 5-, 10- and 50-kopeck flavors. However, given the fact that prices below 1 rouble are a rare sight in Russia today and most shops round up totals to whole roubles, you will hardly ever come in touch with these coins, except perhaps the 50-kopeck coin.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p> The Russian coins in wide use start with a 1-rouble coin, followed by 2-, 5- and 10-rouble coins. Russia’s Central Bank has recently also introduced a 25-rouble coin, which is only minted to commemorate important dates and is hard to spot in regular circulation. The 10-rouble coin can also be issued with thematic designs, which makes them good collectibles.</p>
