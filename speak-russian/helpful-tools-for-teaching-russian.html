						<p>Teaching Russian is a fun and rewarding task.  We are sure of this because it is exactly
what we were at RT Russian are doing for interested learners the world over.  Philological professionals are familiar with traditional materials used for teaching Russian.  But today’s students are far more in touch with resources and materials available on the Internet.  Media tools will make your job easier and learning Russian more interesting for your students.

Teaching Russian can also help you improve your understanding of the language.  We provide material for all levels of language proficiency, so you might even learn something new yourself!

We want to help you in teaching Russian and help your students in their learning of the language.  Together we can provide all the best resources available for this task.  You’ll even have the opportunity to interact with other people who are teaching Russian.  

If you are looking for study aids, audio files, and a dedicated community of language lovers, this is a one-stop shop for all your teaching Russian needs!</p>
