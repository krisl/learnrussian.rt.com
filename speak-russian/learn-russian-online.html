						<p>Nowadays it seems like we do just about everything online - pay bills, keep up with friends, watch television - so why not learn Russian online, too!

Our program is filled with tools and resources that are all available at the click of a mouse (or trackpad), so basically all you need to learn Russian online is a computer and Internet connection - and us, of course!

If you have already toyed with the idea to learn Russian online, you are likely aware that there are lots of different resources out there - but are any of them what you really need?  While there are useful sites and programs, many can be more confusing than useful.  But RT Russian will let you learn Russian online in a way that makes sense to you and your progress.

If you want to learn Russian online, you are probably wanting to take advantage of new media tools.  RT Russian has audio and video files, interesting and lively podcasts, and interactive tests to monitor your progress.
You can also learn Russian online as a supplement to language classes you are taking elsewhere.  The more practice you get, the better; the more fun you have, the more you will enjoy continuing your study!</p><div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; ">To
