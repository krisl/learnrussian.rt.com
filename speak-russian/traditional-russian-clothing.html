						<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Traditional
Russian clothing has its origin in the traditional folk dress and features
motifs typical of the traditional Russian costume. Some of its elements are
widely used today and inspire many international designers to create
collections and add a modern feel to traditional Russian clothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The great
variety of winter clothing traditionally worn in Russia strikes the
imagination: fur coats, sheepskin coats, overcoats, fur-lined dresses—fashions
and cuts have changed over the years, but warm winter attire has always been an
important part of traditional Russian clothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is
traditional Russian clothing without Russian valenki? They were worn both by rural
people and also the tsar’s family. The centuries-long tradition of producing these
warm seamless felt boots by traditional technology has won them great acclaim,
both in Russia and abroad. Rubber shoes, called galoshi, may accompany valenki
to protect them from getting wet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
