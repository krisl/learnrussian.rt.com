						<p>The more words of the Russian vocabulary you know and are familiar with, the more comfortable you are going to be when it comes to the language.  Some words of the Russian vocabulary have the same or similar origins as words in other languages, so chances are you will encounter some luck in your learning.  Beware, of course, of false friends - words you think mean one thing, but, in fact, mean something quite different.  The Russian vocabulary also has plenty of non-borrowed entries, so be prepared for words you’ve probably never seen or heard before.

This course is filled with different ways of improving your Russian vocabulary.  We have fun tools and games for all levels of language learners which are designed to make you see connections and remember the lexicon.   

The best way to remember Russian vocabulary is to drill yourself regularly.  This can be done in a number of ways - including making study sheets, flash cards, and even labelling different objects in your home or office with sticky notes written with Russian vocabulary words.

Even though we live in the digital age, you should never forget the value of a paper dictionary in enhancing your Russian vocabulary.  Being able to flip through a book and look up a word to find it’s meaning is truly a priceless tool.</p><div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
