						<p>Whatever the situation, one can always use basic phrases to get around. This is especially true if you find yourself in a Russian-speaking country but your Russian is not that fluent. RT Russian offers you a list of useful Russian words that can come handy in a variety of circumstances. 

First things first. Start with greetings by saying “<b>zdravstvuite</b>” or, more informal, “<b>privyet</b>”. When you leave, you can either say “<b>do svidaniya</b>” or the less formal “<b>poka</b>”.

Using such useful Russian words as “<b>spasibo</b>” (thank you), “<b>pozhaluista</b>” (please/you’re welcome) or “<b>izvinite</b>” (excuse me) will help you present yourself as a polite person. It also helps to know how to say “yes” and “no” in Russian - “<b>da</b>” and “<b>nyet</b>”, respectively.

Some other useful Russian words include: “<b>mozhno</b>” (may I), “<b>nelzya</b>” (you can’t/you may not), “<b>horosho</b>” (good, ok, well), “<b>plokho</b>” (bad), “<b>pomogite</b>” (help), “<b>politsiya</b>” (police).

In our online course you will find many more useful Russian words for different situations you may encounter in Russia or any other Russian-speaking country. Knowing useful Russian words will add confidence and make you feel more at ease, even if you don’t speak much Russian yet!</p>
