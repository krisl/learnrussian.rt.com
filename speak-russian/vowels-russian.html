						<p>In the Russian language the number of vowel letters and vowel sounds doesn’t coincide. There are 10 vowels in Russian. They are divided into two types, “hard-indicating” and “soft-indicating”, because they indicate whether the following consonant is “hard” or “soft”. So, which one is which?&nbsp;
</p><p>The “hard” vowels in Russian are:</p><p><b>A&nbsp;</b>as in bUt,&nbsp;</p><p><b>Э&nbsp;</b>as in mAp,&nbsp;</p><p><b>У&nbsp;</b>as in mOOd,&nbsp;</p><p><b>О&nbsp;</b>as in nОt&nbsp;</p><p>and the famous&nbsp;<b>Ы&nbsp;</b>, which doesn’t have an equivalent in any other language of the world. To get the sound closest to&nbsp;<b>Ы&nbsp;</b>, take three fingers, put them in your mouth and try saying the English EE.&nbsp;</p><p>The “soft” vowels in Russian are formed by adding a Y at the beginning of their “hard” counterpart. They are:&nbsp;</p><p><b>Я&nbsp;</b>spelled as YA,&nbsp;</p><p><b>Е&nbsp;</b>spelled as YE,&nbsp;</p><p><b>Ё&nbsp;</b>spelled as YO,&nbsp;</p><p><b>Ю&nbsp;</b>spelled as YU&nbsp;</p><p>and&nbsp;<b>И&nbsp;</b>spelled as EE or Y.&nbsp;
</p><p>Another tricky thing about vowels in Russian is that some of them sound differently when not under stress. For example, the word&nbsp;<b>МОЛОКО&nbsp;</b>(milk) is pronounced as ma-la-kO, because&nbsp;<b>O&nbsp;</b>not under stress turns into&nbsp;<b>A</b>.
