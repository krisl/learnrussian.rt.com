						<p>Cartoons are almost equally loved by children and adults alike. For many Russians, Russian cartoons are still associated with Soviet animation. But Russian animators have recently released some cartoons that seem to have won over a big audience and might make it into the history of Russian animation. “Masha and the Bear” is a good example.</p><p> Many Russian cartoons are available online for free. The most famous ones were made by the biggest animation studio in the Soviet Union, Soyuzmultfilm. It was founded in 1936. They started with black and white animation, moving into color in 1937.</p><p> Some Russian cartoons have undoubtedly become part of Russian cultural heritage. Nu, pogodi!, Winnie-the-Pooh, Crocodile Gena, Karlson on the Roof, The Musicians of Bremen, Hedgehog in the Fog, Three from the Buttermilk Village, and Film, film, film! - these Russian cartoons are known and loved by most Russians. Phrases from these cartoons have become set expressions and quotes, and are frequently used in Russian speech. </p><p> As you learn Russian with the help of RT Learn Russian online lessons, you will be able to watch and understand Russian cartoons as well as recognize phrases and quotes from Russian cartoons when you hear them in conversations.
