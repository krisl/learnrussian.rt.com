						<p>The Cyrillic alphabet is the first thing someone who is learning Russian comes across as a beginner. Though it may come across as a huge turn-off and obstacle, it in fact is not and should not be regarded as such for several reasons. Quite a number of letters which make up the Cyrillic alphabet look absolutely identical to those of the Latin script. Some of them are even pronounced the same way. So the Cyrillic alphabet is not something you have to learn from scratch.

Switching back and forth should not be a problem either. After all, millions of Russians do it on a daily basis without any mental effort at all. Getting used to the Cyrillic alphabet is a matter of a few hours to a couple of days, at the most.

At some point you may want to be able to type in Russian. This website provides you with a step-by-step guide how to do it once you need the Cyrillic alphabet working on your computer. You will also find detailed instructions on how to solve common problems with displaying Cyrillic characters on you computer.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:18.0pt;line-height:115%;
