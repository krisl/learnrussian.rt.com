						<p>Today Russia is one of the world’s most promising fields for doing business and a key player in most major industries. Russia’s membership in both the G8 and G20 is proof of its importance.

While many Russian businessmen speak good English, learning business Russian is a good way to show your Russian partners that your interest is long-term and dedicated.

A good business Russian course will encompass a wide range of activities to develop basic language skills like reading, speaking, listening, and writing, combined with exercises to enrich one’s business Russian vocabulary — from general terms to words specific to one’s field of work.

RT provides you with a tool to start learning Russian from any level depending on the results of our entry placement test. While the course is designed to meet the needs of any learner, the authors have also included vocabulary and grammar needed for basic business communication. The website also contains a large database of schools and universities teaching business Russian so that you can plan your further programme of study.</p>
