						<p>Determining how much is enough or just right often proves a hard job. Understanding your level and progress is crucial in learning a foreign language.

The entry placement test provided on this website is a Russian language test which is designed to help you find the appropriate level for your program of study, or, in simple terms, see which topics can be skipped and what you should start with.

No less important is monitoring your progress. You can always go back to the Russian language test to check where you are now and how much your Russian has improved or rely on revision tests also available for major grammar and vocabulary topics to see what needs more work.

Any Russian language test should be done honestly and seriously, as a diagnostic tool can only work right if you do not cheat and mistakes should be spotted and worked on rather than ignored.

A Russian language test passed with flying colours is also an excellent bragging point quite worth dropping in a casual conversation with friends.</p>
